    <h1>At The Boarding Lounge</h1>
    <article>
      <p>At the boarding lounge there are bodies hooked into the internet machines.</p>
      <p>At the boarding lounge people are quiet and sit with crossed legs, their thoughts drowned in the mix of elevator music, television news, old people talking, and a baby crying.</p>
      <p>At the boarding lounge the terror of what happens next–hurtling through the sky in an aerodynamic tin can–is dulled and staged, like watching regular people made into victims in one of those live prank TV shows. I saw one with a lady who thought she was having her makeup done, but they painted her face like a clown’s. While she sat there with her chin up and eyes closed they ran away quietly with the desk and stall paneling, leaving the woman only with a small mirror. When she opened her eyes and found them gone and looked at herself in the mirror she started to cry.</p>
      <p>At the boarding lounge I’m trying not to fall asleep. I’m trying not to be afraid of dying and not had someone tell me they love me and I them and seen it through together. I’m trying not to be afraid that I’ll not board the right plane and end up some place I didn’t want to be.</p>
      <p>I’m trying to be better at goodbyes. And I’m trying not to forget that most important thing.</p>
      <p>At the boarding lounge I’ve sat for twenty minutes. I should fly soon. I should hope to be awake. They are announcing something now. I wish I could understand it.</p>
